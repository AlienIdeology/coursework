* QUIZ: QUESTIONS.txt
This test determines if the answers in QUESTIONS.txt are correct. This
file must be edited so that the correct ( ) choices are replaced with
(X) AND no other changes are made to the file. If you are confident in
your answers but think you may have made inadvertent changes to
QUESTIONS.txt, you can try restoring it with the provided
QUESTIONS.txt.bk file.

The correct output for the test should be
>> ./test_quiz_filter QUESTIONS.txt | sha256sum -C QUESTION.sha256
-: OK

Note: the sha256sum program is used to verify and must be installed to work.
